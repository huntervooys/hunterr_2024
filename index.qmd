# Preface {.unnumbered}

What are we doing here? What is the plan? What are my goals?

## Objectives

My primary objectives are as follows:

-   to introduce R to you as a language and as a set of related tools

-   to familiarize you with the basic structure and functionality of R

-   to introduce important concepts within statistical computing, such as the Monte Carlo Simulation framework

-   to introduce important concepts within probability and statistics, including the central limit theorem, the law of large numbers, and the null-hypothesis significance test

-   to teach you how to use R, and the various associated tools to:

    -   develop visual intuition about probability and statistics

    -   perform common statistical tests using R

    -   answer questions about statistical tests (and their assumptions) using brute-force computation (i.e., simulation via random number generation)

### Learning Objectives

-   discuss R as a language with a history, describe the purpose of R, and to use knowledge of the history and purpose of R to make sense of the structure of R expressions

    -   Read R expressions

    -   Write R expressions that are readable and align with the best practices of the open source R community

-   describe R's relationship to RStudio, RMarkdown, Shiny, Quarto, and Tidyverse; and describe the purpose of these various tools

    -   run R code in several different ways: via a terminal, a console, a script, and RMarkdown documents

-   use R to read, write, and pre-process[^index-1] rectangular data in a consistent, efficient, and minimally complex manner

    -   import data from a variety of sources including: comma-separated values (`.csv`) files, excel spreadshees (`.xlsx` files), google sheets spreadsheets

    -   'tidy' data into the following format: one observation per row, one variable per column, one value per cell

    -   generate synthetic data

    -   use available tools that enable you to store data in a very consistent format with very little effort

-   use R to process data

    -   describe R's data types and the use of each: strings, numerics (floating point "doubles", integers, and complex numbers), logicals, datetimes, and factors

    -   describe R's data structures and the use of each: including, vectors (1-dimensional arrays), matrices (2-dimensional arrays), arrays (more than 2-dimensional arrays), lists (key-value pairs), data frames, and tibbles

    -   use R to process string data by converting it to all lower case, adding a prefix or suffix, etc.

    -   use R to process numeric data by centering and scaling (normalizing) and performing other mathematical operations on data

-   use R and the grammar of graphics (represented by `ggplot2` and related packages) to visualize data and to share data visualizations with others

-   

[^index-1]: pre-processing here refers to very basic, non-mathematical data processing tasks. Pre-processing involves developing a principled framework for storing data and then converting data from the wild into that format.
